# Android Assignment - Architecture Document

## 1. Overview

This document presents the high-level architecture of the Edison Android Exercise application. The app is designed to fetch and display cat facts from an API, allowing users to view.

---

## 2. Architecture Pattern

The application adopts the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern. This approach ensures:
- A clear separation of concerns
- Enhanced testability
- Improved maintainability

---

## 3. Components

### **Model**
- Represents the app's data.
- Includes `CatFactEntity` and `FactResponse` data classes.

### **View**
- Handles the user interface and interactions.
- Implemented via Activity ane Compose Views.

### **ViewModel**
- Acts as a bridge between the View and the Model.
- Manages data preparation for the View and processes user actions.
- Represented by the `FactViewModel` class.

### **Repository**
- Provides a clean abstraction layer for data management.
- The `CatFactRepository` interface and its implementation, `CatFactRepositoryImpl`, manage data retrieval from both the API and the local database.

### **Data Sources**
1. **Remote Data Source**:
   - The `FactService` interface and its implementation handle communication with the Cat Facts API.
2. **Local Data Source**:
   - The `CatFactDao` interface and its implementation manage interactions with the local database using Room.

## 4. Data Flow

1. The **View** (Activity/Fragment) observes the UI state exposed by the **ViewModel**.
2. When the View requires data, it triggers an action in the ViewModel (e.g., `fetchCatFact()`).
3. The ViewModel interacts with the **Repository** to fetch data from the appropriate source (API or database).
4. The Repository returns data to the ViewModel.
5. The ViewModel updates the observed UI state.
6. The View updates its UI based on the updated state.

---

## 5. Dependencies

The application uses the following dependencies:
- **Hilt**: Dependency injection framework for managing object creation and lifecycles.
- **Retrofit**: Facilitates network communication with the API.
- **Room**: Provides local data persistence with a structured database.
- **Coroutines**: Supports asynchronous operations and efficient background thread management.
- **Flow**: Enables reactive data handling and UI updates.

---

## 6. Error Handling

The app employs a `Result` sealed class to represent operation outcomes. This approach allows for granular handling of success cases and various error types (e.g., network, API, unknown).

---

## 7. Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual components, including ViewModel, Repository, and Data Sources, in isolation.

---

## 8. Future Improvements

- Integrate Ui test cases.
- Refine the UI design and overall user experience.
- Introduce additional features and functionality.

---

## 9. Conclusion

This document provides a high-level architectural overview of the Android Exercise application. By leveraging the MVVM pattern and a robust selection of dependencies, the app is designed to be modular, testable, and maintainable. These architectural principles lay a solid foundation for future enhancements and scalability.
